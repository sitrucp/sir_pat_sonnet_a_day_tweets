**@SirPatStew #ASonnetADay tweet links and Twitter audience interest**

Sir Patrick Stewart is doing Shakespeare Sonnet readings from his home during COVID-19 lockdown and they are really good. So good I got Twitter data to create the following:

* A categorical dot plot of each sonnet's tweet like and retweet counts.
* A tabular list of #ASonnetADay tweets with links to tweet to allow others to easily find and watch them.
